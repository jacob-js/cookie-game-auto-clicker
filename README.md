### What's Cookie Clicker ?

_Cookie Clicker is a Javascript game released by Orteil on August 8, 2013. <br><br>
It is an "incrementer" game, as proclaimed by Orteil. 
The point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant 
cookie until you have enough cookies to buy upgrades. The 
seemingly endless gameplay makes it a game that can last an

no longer run it. <br><br>
