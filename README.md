### What's Cookie Clicker ?

_Cookie Clicker is a Javascript game released by Orteil on August 8, 2013. <br><br>
It is an "incrementer" game, as proclaimed by Orteil. The point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant cookie until you have enough cookies to buy upgrades. The seemingly endless gameplay makes it a game that can last an indefinite amount of time, or at least until your device can no longer run it._
